The "Mouse kidney mapper panel data set" needs to be manually downloaded from the company website
https://spatialgenomics.com/data/#other-examples.

Please then extract the data and place it (or use symlinks), such that the subfolder (of the current working directory)
`data` contains the files which start with `SG_MouseKidneyDataRelease_*`.
